### Elevate Your Web Security with Cutting-Edge AI and Machine Learning ###

In an era where digital threats evolve at breakneck speed, traditional security measures no longer suffice. Enter BitFire, the revolutionary WordPress firewall that harnesses the power of Generative AI and Machine Learning. This innovative solution marks a significant leap forward, offering a bespoke security strategy tailored to each individual website.

BitFire introduces a pioneering "block by default" model, setting a new standard in proactive defense. By generating a unique allow list for each site, it ensures that only legitimate traffic gains entry. This approach blocks zero-day attacks instantly, without the need for frequent signature updates. It's not just a firewall; it's your website's personalized guardian, designed to distinguish between friend and foe with unprecedented accuracy.

While traditional firewalls operate on a reactive basis, allowing all traffic except for known threats, BitFire flips the script. The old way exposes your site to the latest threats until updates catch up, a delay that can be critical. BitFire's AI-driven model adapts in real-time, offering immediate protection against even the most cunning of digital adversaries. This means you can update and patch at your leisure, without the panic-driven updates that come with new vulnerabilities.

### WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD OF YOU BEFORE? ###

The BitFire firewall was started as a custom security solution in 2018 for a
small group of WordPress sites by Cory Marsh. Bringing his 20 years of 
enterprise security knowledge and software architecture experience to create the first RASP for WordPress. We had a vision of bringing real enterprise 
grade security solutions to the millions of websites running WordPress. After 
almost 4 years of development and countless late nights we are finally ready 
to offer the highest quality security product available to the WordPress 
community at large. We receiving initial funding in late 2022 we are now officially launching!



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the difference between FREE and PRO versions? =
BitFire free includes our real-time event log, A+ rated security headers, malware scanner, and complete bot blocking which blocks 99% of all Internet threats. 
PRO includes our Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) firewall to prevent vulnerable plugins and themes from executing on your site along with our A+ rated WAF.

= Can BitFire RASP protect my website against zero-day vulnerabilities? =
BitFire has a 100% track record for protecting against every critical 0-day WordPress security vulnerability since 2022 with 0 new signatures required.

= Why do other plugins focus so much for Malware Scanning and Cleaning? =
Great question. Notice how much extra other plugins charge you to clean up malware and how much of their product is focused on finding malware on your system?
They don't do a great job of keeping malware off your site, and then charge you extra when their security fails.

= How much is PRO Version? =
[WAF only version](https://bitfire.co/pricing) is $79.99 / year, and [complete RASP protection](https://bitfire.co/pricing) is $128.00 / year.  

= If other security plugins live up to their hype, why do they scan my site for malware daily? =
That's an excellent question. The majority of popular security plugins create custom signatures for each WordPress plugin vulnerability as they are publicly disclosed. With over 10,000 known WordPress security vulnerabilities and less than 200 signatures, they miss blocking a lot of hacks. They are also unable to block the most common security flaws (access control errors) for anything they do not have a pre-built signature for. To make the situation more difficult, they delay these rules by up to a month for non-paying customers.

= How does Redirection Protection work? =
Our unique software keeps track of every 3rd party domain your web page uses (Facebook, Google, JavaScript APIS, themes, etc.). After several weeks of learning, CSP security headers are sent to visitors instructing their browsers to only use or redirect to your approved domain list.

= Does BitFire prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)? =
BitFire includes outstanding XSS protection, including HTTP headers and content filtering for persistent, reflected, and DOM-based XSS attacks.

= Does BitFire block SQL Injection attacks (SQLi)? =
Yes. BitFire has advanced SQL parsing similar to MySQL syntax parsing and can understand SQL queries regardless of encoding, injected comments, and other evasion techniques.

= What are some examples of RASP blocks? =
* **Adding a new administrator account?** BitFire checks that the current user has the administrator privilege before allowing the account creation.
* **Making a network connection?** BitFire checks the remote system against a list of over 2.5 million malware domains before allowing the connection.
* **Adding or editing a file?** BitFire inspects the filename and content to ensure that it does not edit a PHP file or inject backdoor code. 
* **Redirecting the visitor to another website?** First check the malware domain list before sending the redirect.
* **Is a plugin eval() dynamic PHP Code?** Inspect the code being passed to eval() and block malicious code before executing it.


= Why shouldn't I use WordFence? =
If you use WordFence, you should only use the paid version. WordFence has a team monitoring emerging WordPress vulnerabilities and writing custom rules to block specific exploits. They are very good at it and run a great blog on their work. Paying customers receive these virtual patches as soon as they are available. Free customers receive the patches 30 days later. If your website is vulnerable, it is almost guaranteed to be hacked before the patch is available to free customers. Don't leave your site at risk.

= Is BitFire RASP easy to install? =
Yes, BitFire RASP offers a seamless integration process tailored for WordPress. The setup is user-friendly, and our support team is always ready to assist.

= How is BitFire RASP different from other security plugins? =
BitFire RASP is the only RASP firewall available for WordPress. It's crafted to provide real-time protection by deeply inspecting your site's activity, ensuring comprehensive security without compromising performance.

= Can BitFire block bots and automated attacks? =
BitFire's primary feature is bot blocking which is 100% functional in the free version. 99% of WordPress attacks are from automated tools scanning every domain and IP address for known vulnerabilities. BitFire verifies human web browsers with a JavaScript challenge similar to Cloudflare but over 50 times faster (1/10 second VS 6 seconds). BitFire also includes a list of over 80 search engines and SEO tools that are network verified to ensure only valid bot traffic reaches your site.

= How do I get support if I encounter issues with BitFire RASP? =
You can use [the WordPress support form](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/bitfire/) or visit our website to access our official documentation, which includes in-depth descriptions of security features, common solutions, and comprehensive help. Our dedicated support team is also available to assist you. You can reach out through our support channels, and we'll promptly address any questions or concerns you have.

== Privacy / Monitoring / Data Collection ==

1. Privacy.  We take privacy very seriously. BitFire inspects all traffic going to the webserver and takes care to filter out any potentially sensitive information by replacing it with ***redacted***. The config.ini file includes a list of common sensitive field names under the "filtered_logging" section. You can add additional fields to filter in the config file by adding a line "filtered_logging[field_name] = true" and replacing "field_name" with the name of the desired parameter to filter.

2. BitFire includes an error handler which monitors it's operation. In the event an error is detected _only_ in the BitFire software; including during install, an alert can be sent to BitFire's developer team. The development team monitors these errors in real time and includes fixes for any detected errors in each new release.

3. Malware scanner. BitFire sends tiny 64bit hashes (signatures, or fingerprints) of every file to our hash database. For instance, index.php may hash to the number: 812612388126487. The database is many gigabytes and centrally located on our servers. BitFire uses that information to determine if a file has been modified or is a known good file and sends the results back to your site. Client hashes are never stored off your server.
